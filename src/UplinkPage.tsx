                The company internally employs hundreds of guards but also has
                several hundred more that can be requested on demand from a
                series of different suppliers. The company's main service is
                physical security and these guards are deployed to various
                different worksites all across New South Wales and other
                Australian states.

                The company is quite sizable and as such also has many different
                clients, some which have several different worksites. For
                example, the company does security for many of the hospitals in
                and around the greater Sydney area.

                The main purpose of Uplinked is to provide a seamless way to
                manage Employees, Suppliers, Clients and worksites through a
                combined set of workforce management tools.

                Before moving onto the improvements I first had to understand
                what the current dashboard looked like, and how it fell short of
                the customers requirements.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Reviewing the dashboard we can see that it is more of a
                navigation pane. Further exploration actually revealed that not
                only was it just a navigation pane, but many of the
                "Organisational Control" buttons were simply shortcuts to
                screens that would have been one click away from any of the
                "User Management" buttons.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                For example, clicking on "Manage Clients" brings you to this
                screen:
              </p>

              <ProjectImage
                src="/uplinked/clientsTable.png"
                alt="Manage Clients Screen"
                caption="Client management interface showing redundant navigation"
              />

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Which as you can see just contains the "Add/New Client" button
                in the top right. This revealed significant redundancy in the
                navigation flow.
              </p>

                src="/uplinked/flowchart.jpg"

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Based on the workflow, it is clear that this dashboard has a lot
                of redundancy. Additionally, I found it interesting that the
                dashboard did not display any metrics or action items that you
                would typically expect from a normal dashboard. So, I kept note
                of this decision and moved on to further understand the goals of
                this screen.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The goal of a dashboard is to save time by producing information
                that would normally take a while to gather otherwise. In
                particular we came to a consensus on a few pieces of very
                important information that needs to feature on the dashboard:

                The wireframing process helped establish a clear visual
                hierarchy, ensuring that the most time-sensitive information
                (like unassigned shifts and pending approvals) would be
                immediately visible, while secondary actions remained easily
                accessible but not overwhelming.

                This mockup design successfully transformed a simple navigation
                interface into a powerful operational dashboard that provides
                administrators with immediate visibility into their workforce
                status, pending tasks, and critical alerts - ultimately saving
                significant time in daily operations management.

                The new dashboard design fundamentally changed how Synergy
                Protection Agency manages their workforce operations. By
                consolidating critical information into a single, intuitive
                interface, administrators can now make faster, more informed
                decisions about shift assignments, employee deployment, and
                operational priorities.

                The transformation from a simple navigation interface to a
                comprehensive operational dashboard demonstrates the power of
                user-centered design in enterprise software. By focusing on the
                actual needs of administrators rather than just providing access
                to features, we created a solution that truly supports their
                daily workflow.
