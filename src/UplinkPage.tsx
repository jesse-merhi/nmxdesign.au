              Reviewing the dashboard revealed it was more of a navigation pane. Many of the

              one click away from the "User Management" buttons.

              navigation flow. The full map of this dashboard's navigation flow is shown below.

              licenses or checking on guards currently on site. I initially proposed a tasks list
              then realized everything an admin does could potentially be a task. So I decided to
              map out all aspects of the application to understand different use cases.

              Now that I had a high level idea of what I needed to make I moved onto creating some
              wireframes to map out the general hierarchy of the dashboard. The goal was to focus on
              the layout which would help me to create low fidelity and then high fidelity
              prototypes.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              To start I came up with a general idea of the components I wanted to make and placed

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 mt-6">
              From here I began rearranging the components on the screen until they fit nicely on
              the page. This process was crucial for understanding how the components work together
              and ensuring the most critical information was prominently displayed.

              To simplify the dashboard for users I explored three different layout options

              I needed to decide on the optimal approach for presenting this data.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                After evaluating all options, the best approach was an optimized 'No Scroll'
                solution with internal scrolling capabilities. The scroll option would be harder to
                scale with additional features, and the tab option would hide important information
                requiring extra clicks.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                The optimized approach allows modules to scroll internally while maintaining the
                overall page layout, creating an "at-a-glance" benefit while gracefully handling
                variable amounts of data.
